        In the past, I’ve worked with charitable bodies like the Salvation Army, Sir Roden Cutler Foundation and Headspace for both advocacy and fundraising events. Even during this year I’ve immersed myself with helping not-for-profit organisations like Days for Girls through consulting, and Variety and the Indigenous Literacy Foundation through the invaluable experience I gained as a Charity subcommittee member, which also allowed me to get an inside perspective into how the society functions.
        
        I have a lot of exciting initiatives planned once restrictions ease and I can’t wait to bring these ideas to life! I’m super keen to develop an environment where we can all grow closer while supporting those who need it most 😊`,

        Charity has always been a massive part of my life. So far, I've had experience fundraising and volunteering for charities like Bread of Life, The Arrow Bone Marrow Transplant Foundation, The Red Shield Appeal and TLR. I have also enjoyed being a part of the Charity Subcom this year, which gave an awesome insight into the running of society events.
         
        I'm so keen to share my ideas with you all and hope we can all come together in 2022 to support some really worthy causes, and have fun while doing so :)`,

        Both roles require nuanced skills in organisation, communication, and enthusiasm. As a member of this year’s marketing subcom, I have been able to strengthen these skills by consistently meeting deadlines and reaching out to members of the community for wide society involvement. I would also love the opportunity to give back by passing on knowledge of Adobe and how to make the perfect CP, or by ensuring that administrative matters are dealt with promptly and effectively. In addition, my main aim is to form closer connections between cohorts by supporting a smooth run of events. 
        
        Above all, I simply want to uphold the fun vibes that form the heart of this society– I am wholly committed to furthering its open and animated environment!`,

Co-op subcom has been my favourite role this year - working on projects and bonding with fellow co-ops has reinforced that I would love to continue being a part of this society, specifically as secretary or marketing director. 
        With my thorough organisation skills I’d ensure all admin goes smoothly and communication is clear – meeting agendas along with time management are things I’m more than familiar with after many subcom/case experiences overlapping this year haha. I’m also creative, experienced with Adobe and enthusiastic about event engagement. As a team member, I’m flexible, consistent and always willing to take on any extra work.
        I’m confident that I am well-suited to these roles and can facilitate further growth and connection in Co-op. I am genuinely so passionate about this society and hope I can have the opportunity to continue giving back to you all!`,

These are attributes that I’m passionate to dedicate to the Secretary position for 2022.

        My penchant for organisation and communication complement my aptitude for event planning that I’ve expanded this year with Co-op.

As your Arc Delegate I will ensure that Co-op Soc has nothing but the best relationship with Arc. In my time as a Co-op I learnt that receiving money is very useful, so I will ensure that we get as much support from Arc as possible. I also live only a 5 min drive away from the Arc office so it is very easy for me to reach them (as seen in my photo). I hope to bring my enthusiasm and passion to the executive team to make this society as good as I know it can be.

Furthermore, I'm passionate and keen to work with next year's team to help with social media, bring forward cool tech projects and make big ideas come to life. What I want to do most, however, is create a friendly environment in subcom where we can all work together for something bigger than ourselves.

But don’t be mistaken, whilst I may not possess unmatched athletic physique, I do possess a genuine love for giving back to my community and being involved in charity events. 

        From being a leader of a high school charity group, where we helped raise $1000 worth of funds for the Cancer Council, to participating in my religious community and even partaking in events such as Steptember, I have developed a passion for involving myself in charitable events anyway possible. Through my experience of organising charity events in the past, I have understood what makes an event lit and at the same time follow a worthy cause. Which is why, I’d love the opportunity to be Charity director where I could apply myself and bring to the table unique ideas to raise funds and awareness for those less fortunate than us, and involve our Co-op family in supporting those in need :).

I have experienced its expectations and want to continue it on with my love for writing and literature. Within Co-op, I have helped write material and create the podcast. Outside of Co-op, I have been published in government and UN Australia journals. This means that I have rigorous professional standards for content that is vital for any forward-facing publications as well as internal documentation.

        Complementing these technical skills are my professional skills honed by my executive position at my surf lifesaving club. From my experience leading emergency service teams during COVID, I have developed pressure and time management skills with a strong awareness of organisational frameworks.
